	This is what we call boiler plate code.
	This is code that is pretty standard across
	all HTML files, so we tend to create templates.

	REMEMBER: If you have a question, don't be afraid
	to raise your hand! Learning a new language can
	be intimidating, so I am more than happy to be 
	a resource.

		The head element contains the meta

			meta elements are like the background

			Here, charset="UTF-8" tells the 
			browser we are using UTF-8, a character
			encoding standard! There is also UTF-16
			and UTF-32 standards, but they are
			larger and take up more memory.

			Look at your tab! Title is how we add
			labels to our tabs within the browser.
		--->
		<title>Hello (:</title>
		
		<!---
			link elements are how we tell the broswer
			which additional files are to be used.
			CSS, which stands for Cascading Style
			Sheets, is how we style the webpage, and
			has the .css file extension. The icon
			is the image you see in the tab next
			to "Hello (:". This is an actual image
			in your directory.

			The script element is how we reference
